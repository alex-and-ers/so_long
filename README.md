# So_long

Simple 2d game using minilbx library.

# Rules
1. The player’s goal is to collect every collectible present on the map, then escape
chosing the shortest possible route.
2. The W, A, S, and D keys must be used to move the main character.
3. The player should be able to move in these 4 directions: up, down, left, right.
4. The player should not be able to move into walls.
5. At every move, the current number of movements must be displayed in the shell.
6. You have to use a 2D view (top-down or profile).
7. The game doesn’t have to be real time.
8. Although the given examples show a dolphin theme, you can create the world you
want.

In bonus part:
1. Make the player lose when they touch an enemy patrol.
2. Add some sprite animation.
3. Display the movement count directly on screen instead of writing it in the shell.
